Mark has a business that ships widgets to cities all over the country. If the 
box he ships weighs 5 pounds or more, the cost of shipping increases significantly. 
The boxes he uses to ship his widgets weigh 0.4 pounds each and the widgets vary 
in weight. You are to write a program to help him with his shipping by determining 
if the package containing the widgets listed is overweight or not.


Input
=====
The first line of input will contain a single integer n that indicates the number 
of boxes he needs to ship. Each of the following n lines will contain a list of 
weights of the widgets for that particular box. Each of the weights will be in 
pounds, rounded to hundredths and separated by a space.  There will be 7 widget
weights total on each line.

For each package, and on a separate line, print OK if the package weighs less 
than 5 pounds or print OVERWEIGHT if the package weighs 5 pounds or more.
